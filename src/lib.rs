//! Interface for defining and solving SAT problems.
//!
//!
//! The [Boolean satisfiability][] problem (SAT for short) asks, for a given
//! Boolean formula, whether there exists an assignment of values (true or false) to
//! the formula's variables such that the formula evaluates to true.
//!
//! SAT is [NP-complete][], which implies two things:
//!
//! 1. A large number of important problems (e.g. in program analysis, circuit design, or
//!    logistical planning) may be seen as instances of SAT.
//!
//! 2. It is believed that no algorithm exists which efficiently solves all instances
//!    of SAT.
//!
//! The observation (1) is significant in spite of (2) because there exist
//! algorithms (such as [DPLL][]) which efficiently solve the SAT instances one encounters
//! *in practice*.
//!
//! This crate allows the user to formulate instances of SAT and to solve them using
//! off-the-shelf SAT solvers.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Create a SAT instance.
//! let mut i = sat::Instance::new();
//! let x = i.fresh_var();
//! let y = i.fresh_var();
//! let z = i.fresh_var();
//! i.assert_any(&[x, z]);        //     (x OR z)
//! i.assert_any(&[!x, !y, !z]);  // AND (!x OR !y OR !z)
//! i.assert_any(&[y]);           // AND (y = TRUE)
//!
//! // Use the external program `minisat` as a solver.
//! let s = sat::solver::Dimacs::new(|| Command::new("minisat"));
//!
//! // Solve the instance and check that it meets our requirements.
//! let a = s.solve(&i).unwrap();
//! assert!(a.get(x) || a.get(z));
//! assert!(!a.get(x) || !a.get(y) || !a.get(z));
//! assert!(a.get(y));
//!
//! // Add a clause which makes the instance impossible to satisfy,
//! // and check that the solver recognizes as much.
//! i.assert_any(&[!y]);
//! assert!(s.solve(&i).is_none());
//! ```
//!
//! For a more elaborate example, see `examples/petersen.rs` which produces a 3-coloring
//! of the [Petersen graph][].
